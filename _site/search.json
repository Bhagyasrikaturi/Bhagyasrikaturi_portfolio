    "text": "In this TidyTuesday analysis, I explored retail sales data using R and leveraged the power of Plotly for interactive visualizations. The dataset, likely sourced from the TidyTuesday project, was loaded and examined to gain insights into retail trends. Plotly, a dynamic plotting library, was employed to create engaging and interactive charts, allowing for a deeper understanding of sales patterns, seasonality, or any trends within the retail sector. This approach not only facilitates exploration but also enhances the communicative aspect of data findings through visually appealing and interactive plots.\n\n# Load necessary

of 0.0155, indicating that the model explains only a small proportion of the variance in the weekly sales. Additionally, the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 553,801.7 suggests a significant deviation between the predicted and actual sales values, emphasizing the limitations of the linear model in capturing the underlying patterns in the data.\nOn the other hand, the Random Forest model exhibited better performance with a higher R-squared value of 0.1402, signifying a greater ability to explain variability in weekly sales. The lower RMSE of 521,092.6 further supports the Random Forest model as a more accurate predictor compared to the linear regression model. This suggests that the Random Forest algorithm, which leverages ensemble learning and decision trees, provides a more robust and flexible approach for capturing the complex relationships within the Walmart sales data set."

Remove observations from NFLX1 if an analyst has multiple predictions for the same year and keep the last one (the most recent forecast for each year). Name your new dataset as NFLX2. This step is crucial for successful execution of the following tasks. Print the dimension of NFLX2.\nCheck your work: If your NFLX2 dataset has 641 rows and 14 columns, then you are on the right track.

If not, please seek help!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask 4: Calculate past accuracy\n\n\n\n\nCreate a copy of NFLX2 and call it NFLX3\nFor every year within the dataset NFLX3, compute the forecasting performance of each analyst for the current year and store the results in a new column labeled accuracy. In the calculation of forecast performance, you can use the VALUE-ACTUAL as the forecast accuracy measure.\nFor each year in the NFLX3 dataset, compute the forecasting performance of each analyst from the previous year and store the results in a new column called past_accuracy\nAs an example, consider the year 2006, where analyst 1047, employed at brokerage house 464, provided an estimated end-of-period EPS of 0.0929 (VALUE). However, the actual EPS for that year turned out to be 0.1014 (ACTUAL), resulting in a forecasting error of -0.0085. Consequently, in the subsequent year, 2007, the past_accuracy metric for analyst 1047 would reflect this error by taking the value of -0.0085 (VALUE-ACTUAL).\nThis action will create some missing values and this is perfectly fine.\nIf your code produces 144 NAs, then you are on the right track.\nNote that we are creating copies of the original dataset at each step to facilitate error detection in case any mistakes occur during the process.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Create a copy of NFLX2 and call it NFLX3\nNFLX3 &lt;- NFLX2\n\n# Task 4: Calculate past accuracy\n\n# For every year within the dataset NFLX3, compute the forecasting performance of each analyst for the current year and store the results in a new column labeled accuracy.\nNFLX3 &lt;- NFLX3 %&gt;%\n  group_by(YEAR, ANALYS) %&gt;%\n  mutate(accuracy = VALUE - ACTUAL)\n\n# For each year in the NFLX3 dataset, compute the forecasting performance of each analyst from the previous year and store the results in a new column called past_accuracy\nNFLX3 &lt;- NFLX3 %&gt;%\n  group_by(ANALYS) %&gt;%\n  arrange(YEAR) %&gt;%\n  mutate(past_accuracy = lag(accuracy))\n\n# Check if the code produces 144 NAs\nsum(is.na(NFLX3$past_accuracy))\n\n[1] 144\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask 5: Forecast Horizon\n\n\n\n\nThe longer the forecast horizon, the higher the uncertainty associated with EPS forecasts. To control for this fact, create a new column in NFLX3 called horizon that captures the forecast horizon (ANNDATS_ACT- ANNDATS) for each analyst.\nWe anticipate observing a negative correlation between accuracy and horizon. Typically, as the forecast horizon increases, the accuracy tends to decrease, and vice versa. However, in our dataset, there is an exception where we find a positive correlation between accuracy and horizon for one specific year. Write an R code to identify and determine which year exhibits this positive correlation.\nNeed Written Response in this callout: Enter the year in here.\n2011 2012 2103 2015 and 2018 with 2018 having a forecast value of 0.24.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Task 5: Forecast Horizon\n# Calculate past accuracy and forecast horizon\nNFLX3 &lt;- NFLX3 %&gt;% group_by(ANALYS) %&gt;% arrange(YEAR) %&gt;% mutate(past_accuracy = lag(accuracy, default = NA))\nNFLX3 &lt;- NFLX3 %&gt;% mutate(horizon = as.numeric(difftime(ANNDATS_ACT, ANNDATS, units = \"days\")))\n\n# Calculate correlation and find positive correlation year\ncorrelation_by_year &lt;- NFLX3 %&gt;% group_by(YEAR) %&gt;% summarise(correlation = cor(accuracy, horizon, use = \"complete.obs\"))\npositive_corr_year &lt;- correlation_by_year %&gt;% filter(correlation &gt; 0)\n\n# Print positive correlation year with correlation values\npositive_corr_year %&gt;% mutate(correlation = round(correlation, 2)) %&gt;% kable() %&gt;% kable_styling(bootstrap_options = \"striped\")\n\n\n\n\nYEAR\ncorrelation\n\n\n\n\n20111231\n0.23\n\n\n20121231\n0.07\n\n\n20131231\n0.02\n\n\n20151231\n0.06\n\n\n20181231\n0.24\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 6: Experience\n\n\n\n\nWe assume that if an analyst is monitoring a company for a long period of time, he/she is expected to make more informed predictions.

To predict this EPS value based on historical data, we will employ a linear regression model using the dataset NFLX3 up until the year 2019. In this model, the target variable will be ACTUAL and the predictor variables will include VALUE and past_accuracy. C.all your model as model1.\nNeed Written Response in this callout: Using the linear regression model ‘model1,’ which has been trained on historical data up to the year 2019, what is the forecasted EPS (Earnings Per Share) for the year 2020? Please provide a brief explanation of the method you employed to make this prediction. If you encountered any challenges or were unable to make the calculation, briefly describe the specific issues you encountered.\n\nUsing the linear regression model 'model1,' trained on historical data up to the year 2019, we can forecast the EPS (Earnings Per Share) for the year 2020. The method employed involves calculating the R-squared value of the model, which measures the goodness of fit. If the R-squared value is high (greater than 0.5 in this case), we proceed with forecasting.\nIn this example, the code calculates the mean of the 'past_accuracy' variable. If the R-squared value is satisfactory, we generate a forecast for the future period. We create a new data frame for the future period with values for the independent variables (VALUE and past_accuracy). The code then uses the 'predict' function to estimate the EPS for the future period.\nIf the R-squared value is low, a warning message is provided, indicating that the model may not accurately predict future EPS.\nThe method allows us to make forecasts if the model's fit is deemed appropriate. However, we encountered issues with data configuration or model training, those specific challenges should be addressed to ensure the accuracy of the model\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Calculate the mean of past_accuracy\nmean_past_accuracy &lt;- mean(NFLX3$past_accuracy, na.rm = TRUE)\n\n# Convert the 'YEAR' column to the desired format\nNFLX3$YEAR &lt;- as.POSIXct(NFLX3$YEAR, format = \"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S\")\n\n# Create the linear regression model using historical data up to the year 2019\nmodel1 &lt;- lm(ACTUAL ~ VALUE + past_accuracy, data = NFLX3)\n\n# Get the R-squared value of the model\nr_squared &lt;- summary(model1)$r.squared\n\n# If the R-squared value is high, then we can use the model to generate a forecast\nif (r_squared &gt; 0.5) {\n  # Create a new data frame for the future period with the values of the independent variables\n  new_data_future &lt;- data.frame(\n    VALUE = 6.08, # Replace this with the actual value of VALUE for the future period\n    past_accuracy = mean_past_accuracy\n  )\n\n  # Predict the EPS for the future period\n  predicted_eps_future &lt;- predict(model1, newdata = new_data_future)\n\n  # Print the forecasted EPS for the future period\n  cat(\"Forecasted EPS for future period: $\", round(predicted_eps_future, 2))\n} else {\n  # Print a warning message\n  cat(\"The R-squared value is low, so the model may not be able to accurately predict future values of the dependent variable.\")\n}\n\nForecasted EPS for future period: $ 6.3\n\n# Print the mean of past_accuracy\ncat(\"Mean past_accuracy: \", round(mean_past_accuracy, 2))\n\nMean past_accuracy:  -0.09\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask 9: Prediction 2\n\n\n\n\nAs an alternative approach, instead of modeling the ‘ACTUAL’ value, we can obtain the mean and median forecasts for the year 2020 as our best estimates of the EPS value for that year.\nNeed Written Response in this callout: Please calculate these forecasts and then compare them with the results from the previous task. Finally, provide your insights and comments based on your findings.\n\nIn this alternative approach, we opted to calculate the mean and median forecasts for the year 2020 as our best estimates of the EPS value. The mean forecast for 2020 is approximately $1.24, while the median forecast is significantly lower, at approximately $0.41. When comparing these results with the linear regression model from the previous task, it's evident that the model-based forecast might provide a more detailed and potentially accurate prediction. However, these two approaches have their unique merits and drawbacks. The model-driven forecast takes into account historical relationships and variables like 'past_accuracy,' but it heavily relies on the quality of the model fit, as indicated by the R-squared value. On the other hand, the mean and median forecasts provide simple summary statistics but might lack the predictive power of a well-fitted model. The choice between these methods should be influenced by the data quality and the context of the analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Calculate the mean forecast\nmean_forecast &lt;- mean(NFLX3$VALUE, na.rm = TRUE)\n\n# Calculate the median forecast\nmedian_forecast &lt;- median(NFLX3$VALUE, na.rm = TRUE)\n\n# Print the mean and median forecasts\ncat(\"Mean forecast for 2020: $\", round(mean_forecast, 2))\n\nMean forecast for 2020: $ 1.24\n\ncat(\"Median forecast for 2020: $\", round(median_forecast, 2))\n\nMedian forecast for 2020: $ 0.41\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask 10: Averages\n\n\n\n\nGenerate a new dataset named NFLX4 by aggregating data from NFLX3 Include the variables size, experience, horizon, accuracy, past_accuracy, and ACTUAL in NFLX4. When calculating the yearly averages for these variables, ignore any missing values (NAs). Present a summary of the NFLX4 dataset.\nNeed Written Response in this callout: Subsequently, employ correlation analysis or exploratory data analysis to get insights into the relationships between these variables and ‘ACTUAL,’ if such relationships exist.\n\nAfter conducting correlation analysis and exploratory data analysis on the dataset NFLX4, several interesting insights into the relationships between variables and 'ACTUAL' have emerged\nThe correlation matrix reveals that 'ACTUAL' is positively correlated with 'size' (0.18) and 'experience' (0.69), indicating that, on average, larger groups of analysts and analysts with more experience tend to provide more accurate forecasts for the 'ACTUAL' earnings per share.\nConversely, 'ACTUAL' is negatively correlated with 'horizon' (-0.63) and 'past_accuracy' (-0.80). This suggests that analysts with a longer forecasting horizon and those who have made more accurate predictions in the past tend to have less accurate forecasts for 'ACTUAL' earnings per share.\nIn the exploratory data analysis, scatter plots further highlight these relationships. For instance, the scatter plot of 'ACTUAL' against 'size' shows a general trend of improved accuracy as the number of analysts increases.\nThese findings provide valuable insights for understanding the factors that influence the accuracy of earnings per share forecasts ('ACTUAL'). Larger analyst groups and more experienced analysts tend to provide more accurate forecasts, while longer forecasting horizons and a history of past accuracy can lead to less accurate predictions. These relationships can be crucial for analysts, investors, and decision-makers in the financial domain.\n\n\n\n# Aggregate data and calculate yearly averages, ignoring missing values (NAs)\nNFLX4 &lt;- NFLX3 %&gt;%\n  group_by(YEAR) %&gt;%\n  summarise(\n    size = mean(size, na.rm = TRUE),\n    experience = mean(experience, na.rm = TRUE),\n    horizon = mean(horizon, na.rm = TRUE),\n    accuracy = mean(accuracy, na.rm = TRUE),\n    past_accuracy = mean(past_accuracy, na.rm = TRUE),\n    ACTUAL = mean(ACTUAL, na.rm = TRUE)\n  )\n\n# Present a summary of the NFLX4 dataset\nsummary(NFLX4)\n\n      YEAR                          size         experience   \n Min.   :1970-08-20 20:27:11   Min.   :1.000   Min.   :1.000  \n 1st Qu.:1970-08-21 08:57:11   1st Qu.:1.074   1st Qu.:2.664  \n Median :1970-08-21 21:27:11   Median :1.105   Median :3.400  \n Mean   :1970-08-21 21:27:11   Mean   :1.132   Mean   :3.611  \n 3rd Qu.:1970-08-22 09:57:11   3rd Qu.:1.202   3rd Qu.:4.869  \n Max.   :1970-08-22 22:27:11   Max.   :1.300   Max.   :6.061  \n                                                              \n    horizon           accuracy         past_accuracy           ACTUAL       \n Min.   :0.06284   Min.   :-0.822085   Min.   :-0.798219   Min.   :-0.0050  \n 1st Qu.:0.08547   1st Qu.:-0.019087   1st Qu.:-0.028736   1st Qu.: 0.0914  \n Median :0.09289   Median :-0.015035   Median :-0.013423   Median : 0.2643  \n Mean   :0.09004   Mean   :-0.048310   Mean   :-0.060652   Mean   : 0.9248  \n 3rd Qu.:0.09512   3rd Qu.:-0.005415   3rd Qu.:-0.009260   3rd Qu.: 0.5678  \n Max.   :0.10656   Max.   : 0.121449   Max.   :-0.001547   Max.   : 6.0800  \n                                       NA's   :1                            \n\n# Correlation analysis\ncorrelation_matrix &lt;- cor(NFLX4[, c(\"size\", \"experience\", \"horizon\", \"accuracy\", \"past_accuracy\", \"ACTUAL\")], use = \"complete.obs\")\n\n# Print correlation matrix\nprint(correlation_matrix)\n\n                     size  experience    horizon    accuracy past_accuracy\nsize           1.00000000  0.07451284 -0.1317823 -0.04537307    -0.1810330\nexperience     0.07451284  1.00000000 -0.4844637 -0.25882136    -0.4620906\nhorizon       -0.13178225 -0.48446371  1.0000000  0.22264895     0.4979377\naccuracy      -0.04537307 -0.25882136  0.2226489  1.00000000    -0.1604379\npast_accuracy -0.18103301 -0.46209061  0.4979377 -0.16043792     1.0000000\nACTUAL         0.18223220  0.68707354 -0.6346966 -0.31928984    -0.7958850\n                  ACTUAL\nsize           0.1822322\nexperience     0.6870735\nhorizon       -0.6346966\naccuracy      -0.3192898\npast_accuracy -0.7958850\nACTUAL         1.0000000\n\n# Exploratory data analysis\n# Create scatter plots to explore relationships\n\n# Scatter plot of ACTUAL vs. size\nggplot(NFLX4, aes(x = size, y = ACTUAL)) +\n  geom_point(color = \"blue\", shape = 1) +\n  ggtitle(\"ACTUAL vs. size\") +\n  xlab(\"size\") +\n  ylab(\"ACTUAL\")\n\n\n\n# Scatter plot of ACTUAL vs. experience\nggplot(NFLX4, aes(x = experience, y = ACTUAL)) +\n  geom_point(color = \"green\", shape = 2) +\n  ggtitle(\"ACTUAL vs. experience\") +\n  xlab(\"experience\") +\n  ylab(\"ACTUAL\")\n\n\n\n# Scatter plot of ACTUAL vs. horizon\nggplot(NFLX4, aes(x = horizon, y = ACTUAL)) +\n  geom_point(color = \"red\", shape = 3) +\n  ggtitle(\"ACTUAL vs. horizon\") +\n  xlab(\"horizon\") +\n  ylab(\"ACTUAL\")\n\n\n\n# Scatter plot of ACTUAL vs. accuracy\nggplot(NFLX4, aes(x = accuracy, y = ACTUAL)) +\n  geom_point(color = \"orange\", shape = 4) +\n  ggtitle(\"ACTUAL vs. accuracy\") +\n  xlab(\"accuracy\") +\n  ylab(\"ACTUAL\")\n\n\n\n# Scatter plot of ACTUAL vs. past_accuracy\nggplot(NFLX4, aes(x = past_accuracy, y = ACTUAL)) +\n  geom_point(color = \"purple\", shape = 5) +\n  ggtitle(\"ACTUAL vs. past_accuracy\") +\n  xlab(\"past_accuracy\") +\n  ylab(\"ACTUAL\")\n\nWarning: Removed 1 rows containing missing values (`geom_point()`).\n\n\n\n\n# Save NFLX4 to a CSV file if needed\n# write.csv(NFLX4, \"NFLX4.csv\", row.names = FALSE)"

In the calculation of forecast performance, you can use the VALUE-ACTUAL as the forecast accuracy measure.\nFor each year in the NFLX3 dataset, compute the forecasting performance of each analyst from the previous year and store the results in a new column called past_accuracy\nAs an example, consider the year 2006, where analyst 1047, employed at brokerage house 464, provided an estimated end-of-period EPS of 0.0929 (VALUE). However, the actual EPS for that year turned out to be 0.1014 (ACTUAL), resulting in a forecasting error of -0.0085. Consequently, in the subsequent year, 2007, the past_accuracy metric for analyst 1047 would reflect this error by taking the value of -0.0085 (VALUE-ACTUAL).\nThis action will create some missing values and this is perfectly fine.\nIf your code produces 144 NAs, then you are on the right track.\nNote that we are creating copies of the original dataset at each step to facilitate error detection in case any mistakes occur during the process."

To predict this EPS value based on historical data, we will employ a linear regression model using the dataset NFLX3 up until the year 2019. In this model, the target variable will be ACTUAL and the predictor variables will include VALUE and past_accuracy. C.all your model as model1.\nNeed Written Response in this callout: Using the linear regression model ‘model1,’ which has been trained on historical data up to the year 2019, what is the forecasted EPS (Earnings Per Share) for the year 2020? Please provide a brief explanation of the method you employed to make this prediction. If you encountered any challenges or were unable to make the calculation, briefly describe the specific issues you encountered.\n\nUsing the linear regression model 'model1,' trained on historical data up to the year 2019, we can forecast the EPS (Earnings Per Share) for the year 2020. The method employed involves calculating the R-squared value of the model, which measures the goodness of fit. If the R-squared value is high (greater than 0.5 in this case), we proceed with forecasting.\nIn this example, the code calculates the mean of the 'past_accuracy' variable. If the R-squared value is satisfactory, we generate a forecast for the future period. We create a new data frame for the future period with values for the independent variables (VALUE and past_accuracy). The code then uses the 'predict' function to estimate the EPS for the future period.\nIf the R-squared value is low, a warning message is provided, indicating that the model may not accurately predict future EPS.\nThe method allows us to make forecasts if the model's fit is deemed appropriate. However, we encountered issues with data configuration or model training, those specific challenges should be addressed to ensure the accuracy of the model"

Finally, provide your insights and comments based on your findings.\n\nIn this alternative approach, we opted to calculate the mean and median forecasts for the year 2020 as our best estimates of the EPS value. The mean forecast for 2020 is approximately $1.24, while the median forecast is significantly lower, at approximately $0.41. When comparing these results with the linear regression model from the previous task, it's evident that the model-based forecast might provide a more detailed and potentially accurate prediction. However, these two approaches have their unique merits and drawbacks. The model-driven forecast takes into account historical relationships and variables like 'past_accuracy,' but it heavily relies on the quality of the model fit, as indicated by the R-squared value. On the other hand, the mean and median forecasts provide simple summary statistics but might lack the predictive power of a well-fitted model. The choice between these methods should be influenced by the data quality and the context of the analysis."

When calculating the yearly averages for these variables, ignore any missing values (NAs). Present a summary of the NFLX4 dataset.\nNeed Written Response in this callout: Subsequently, employ correlation analysis or exploratory data analysis to get insights into the relationships between these variables and ‘ACTUAL,’ if such relationships exist.\n\nAfter conducting correlation analysis and exploratory data analysis on the dataset NFLX4, several interesting insights into the relationships between variables and 'ACTUAL' have emerged\nThe correlation matrix reveals that 'ACTUAL' is positively correlated with 'size' (0.18) and 'experience' (0.69), indicating that, on average, larger groups of analysts and analysts with more experience tend to provide more accurate forecasts for the 'ACTUAL' earnings per share.\nConversely, 'ACTUAL' is negatively correlated with 'horizon' (-0.63) and 'past_accuracy' (-0.80). This suggests that analysts with a longer forecasting horizon and those who have made more accurate predictions in the past tend to have less accurate forecasts for 'ACTUAL' earnings per share.\nIn the exploratory data analysis, scatter plots further highlight these relationships. For instance, the scatter plot of 'ACTUAL' against 'size' shows a general trend of improved accuracy as the number of analysts increases.\nThese findings provide valuable insights for understanding the factors that influence the accuracy of earnings per share forecasts ('ACTUAL'). Larger analyst groups and more experienced analysts tend to provide more accurate forecasts, while longer forecasting horizons and a history of past accuracy can lead to less accurate predictions. These relationships can be crucial for analysts, investors, and decision-makers in the financial domain.\n\n\n\n# Aggregate data and calculate yearly averages, ignoring missing values (NAs)\nNFLX4 &lt;- NFLX3 %&gt;%\n  group_by(YEAR) %&gt;%\n  summarise(\n    size = mean(size, na.rm = TRUE),\n    experience = mean(experience, na.rm = TRUE),\n    horizon = mean(horizon, na.rm = TRUE),\n    accuracy = mean(accuracy, na.rm = TRUE),\n    past_accuracy = mean(past_accuracy, na.rm = TRUE),\n    ACTUAL = mean(ACTUAL, na.rm = TRUE)\n  )\n\n# Present a summary of the NFLX4 dataset\nsummary(NFLX4)\n\n      YEAR                          size         experience   \n Min.   :1970-08-20 20:27:11   Min.   :1.000   Min.   :1.000  \n 1st Qu.:1970-08-21 08:57:11   1st Qu.:1.074   1st Qu.:2.664  \n Median :1970-08-21 21:27:11   Median :1.105   Median :3.400  \n Mean   :1970-08-21 21:27:11   Mean   :1.132   Mean   :3.611  \n 3rd Qu.:1970-08-22 09:57:11   3rd Qu.:1.202   3rd Qu.:4.869  \n Max.   :1970-08-22 22:27:11   Max.   :1.300   Max.   :6.061  \n                                                              \n    horizon           accuracy         past_accuracy           ACTUAL       \n Min.   :0.06284   Min.   :-0.822085   Min.   :-0.798219   Min.   :-0.0050  \n 1st Qu.:0.08547   1st Qu.:-0.019087   1st Qu.:-0.028736   1st Qu.: 0.0914  \n Median :0.09289   Median :-0.015035   Median :-0.013423   Median : 0.2643  \n Mean   :0.09004   Mean   :-0.048310   Mean   :-0.060652   Mean   : 0.9248  \n 3rd Qu.:0.09512   3rd Qu.:-0.005415   3rd Qu.:-0.009260   3rd Qu.: 0.5678  \n Max.   :0.10656   Max.   : 0.121449   Max.   :-0.001547   Max.   : 6.0800  \n                                       NA's   :1                            \n\n# Correlation analysis\ncorrelation_matrix &lt;- cor(NFLX4[, c(\"size\", \"experience\", \"horizon\", \"accuracy\", \"past_accuracy\", \"ACTUAL\")], use = \"complete.obs\")\n\n# Print correlation matrix\nprint(correlation_matrix)\n\n                     size  experience    horizon    accuracy past_accuracy\nsize           1.00000000  0.07451284 -0.1317823 -0.04537307    -0.1810330\nexperience     0.07451284  1.00000000 -0.4844637 -0.25882136    -0.4620906\nhorizon       -0.13178225 -0.48446371  1.0000000  0.22264895     0.4979377\naccuracy      -0.04537307 -0.25882136  0.2226489  1.00000000    -0.1604379\npast_accuracy -0.18103301 -0.46209061  0.4979377 -0.16043792     1.0000000\nACTUAL         0.18223220  0.68707354 -0.6346966 -0.31928984    -0.7958850\n                  ACTUAL\nsize           0.1822322\nexperience     0.6870735\nhorizon       -0.6346966\naccuracy      -0.3192898\npast_accuracy -0.7958850\nACTUAL         1.0000000\n\n# Exploratory data analysis\n# Create scatter plots to explore relationships\n\n# Scatter plot of ACTUAL vs. size\nggplot(NFLX4, aes(x = size, y = ACTUAL)) +\n  geom_point(color = \"blue\", shape = 1) +\n  ggtitle(\"ACTUAL vs. size\") +\n  xlab(\"size\") +\n  ylab(\"ACTUAL\")\n\n\n\n# Scatter plot of ACTUAL vs. experience\nggplot(NFLX4, aes(x = experience, y = ACTUAL)) +\n  geom_point(color = \"green\", shape = 2) +\n  ggtitle(\"ACTUAL vs. experience\") +\n  xlab(\"experience\") +\n  ylab(\"ACTUAL\")\n\n\n\n# Scatter plot of ACTUAL vs. horizon\nggplot(NFLX4, aes(x = horizon, y = ACTUAL)) +\n  geom_point(color = \"red\", shape = 3) +\n  ggtitle(\"ACTUAL vs. horizon\") +\n  xlab(\"horizon\") +\n  ylab(\"ACTUAL\")\n\n\n\n# Scatter plot of ACTUAL vs. accuracy\nggplot(NFLX4, aes(x = accuracy, y = ACTUAL)) +\n  geom_point(color = \"orange\", shape = 4) +\n  ggtitle(\"ACTUAL vs. accuracy\") +\n  xlab(\"accuracy\") +\n  ylab(\"ACTUAL\")\n\n\n\n# Scatter plot of ACTUAL vs. past_accuracy\nggplot(NFLX4, aes(x = past_accuracy, y = ACTUAL)) +\n  geom_point(color = \"purple\", shape = 5) +\n  ggtitle(\"ACTUAL vs. past_accuracy\") +\n  xlab(\"past_accuracy\") +\n  ylab(\"ACTUAL\")\n\nWarning: Removed 1 rows containing missing values (`geom_point()`).\n\n\n\n\n# Save NFLX4 to a CSV file if needed\n# write.csv(NFLX4, \"NFLX4.csv\", row.names = FALSE)"

Initially, it generates a data set with a defined relationship between variables X and Y. The exploratory data analysis (EDA) includes displaying the data set's initial rows and presenting summary statistics. Subsequently, it visualizes the relationship between X and Y through a scatter plot. The code then fits several machine learning models, including Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), to the data. Model evaluation is performed by calculating the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) for each model, providing a quantitative measure of their predictive accuracy. Finally, the code visually compares the data and regression lines of the Linear Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest models in a single plot, offering insights into their respective fits to the underlying data."
