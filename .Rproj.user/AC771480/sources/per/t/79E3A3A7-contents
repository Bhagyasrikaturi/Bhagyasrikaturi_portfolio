## BIO

I'm Bhagyasri Katuri, a detail-oriented Data Analyst with a year of experience. Currently pursuing an Advanced Data Analytics degree at UNT (Jan 2023 - Dec 2024), my background includes serving as a Data Analyst at EverestDx PVT Limited (Oct 2020 - Dec 2022). I excel in data analysis, use tools like Excel, Java, SQL, Adobe XD, and Illustrator, and have a knack for data visualization and effective communication. I look forward to contributing valuable insights to UNT's data-driven initiatives.
